// dear imgui, v1.90.1
// (demo code)

// Help:
// - Read FAQ at http://dearimgui.com/faq
// - Call and read ImGui::ShowDemoWindow() in imgui_demo.cpp. All applications in examples/ are doing that.
// - Need help integrating Dear ImGui in your codebase?
//   - Read Getting Started https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Getting-Started
//   - Read 'Programmer guide' in imgui.cpp for notes on how to setup Dear ImGui in your codebase.
// Read imgui.cpp for more details, documentation and comments.

//---------------------------------------------------
// PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS FILE FROM YOUR PROJECT!
//---------------------------------------------------
// Message to the person tempted to delete this file when integrating Dear ImGui into their codebase:
// Think again! It is the most useful reference code that you and other coders will want to refer to and call.
// Have the ImGui::ShowDemoWindow() function wired in an always-available debug menu of your game/app!
// Also include Metrics! ItemPicker! DebugLog! and other debug features.
// Removing this file from your project is hindering access to documentation for everyone in your team,
// likely leading you to poorer usage of the library.
// Everything in this file will be stripped out by the linker if you don't call ImGui::ShowDemoWindow().
// If you want to link core Dear ImGui in your shipped builds but want a thorough guarantee that the demo will not be
// linked, you can setup your imconfig.h with #define IMGUI_DISABLE_DEMO_WINDOWS and those functions will be empty.
// In another situation, whenever you have Dear ImGui available you probably want this to be available for reference.
// Thank you,
// -Your beloved friend, imgui_demo.cpp (which you won't delete)

//--------------------------------------------
// ABOUT THE MEANING OF THE 'static' KEYWORD:
//--------------------------------------------
// In this demo code, we frequently use 'static' variables inside functions.
// A static variable persists across calls. It is essentially a global variable but declared inside the scope of the function.
// Think of "static int n = 0;" as "global int n = 0;" !
// We do this IN THE DEMO because we want:
// - to gather code and data in the same place.
// - to make the demo source code faster to read, faster to change, smaller in size.
// - it is also a convenient way of storing simple UI related information as long as your function
//   doesn't need to be reentrant or used in multiple threads.
// This might be a pattern you will want to use in your code, but most of the data you would be working
// with in a complex codebase is likely going to be stored outside your functions.

//-----------------------------------------
// ABOUT THE CODING STYLE OF OUR DEMO CODE
//-----------------------------------------
// The Demo code in this file is designed to be easy to copy-and-paste into your application!
// Because of this:
// - We never omit the ImGui:: prefix when calling functions, even though most code here is in the same namespace.
// - We try to declare static variables in the local scope, as close as possible to the code using them.
// - We never use any of the helpers/facilities used internally by Dear ImGui, unless available in the public API.
// - We never use maths operators on ImVec2/ImVec4. For our other sources files we use them, and they are provided
//   by imgui.h using the IMGUI_DEFINE_MATH_OPERATORS define. For your own sources file they are optional
//   and require you either enable those, either provide your own via IM_VEC2_CLASS_EXTRA in imconfig.h.
//   Because we can't assume anything about your support of maths operators, we cannot use them in imgui_demo.cpp.

// Navigating this file:
// - In Visual Studio: CTRL+comma ("Edit.GoToAll") can follow symbols in comments, whereas CTRL+F12 ("Edit.GoToImplementation") cannot.
// - With Visual Assist installed: ALT+G ("VAssistX.GoToImplementation") can also follow symbols in comments.
